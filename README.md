This project is about me getting to learn JS and AngularJS.

If you found step by anything that doesn't seem to be quite right then:
  * You're welcome to issue a ticket and explain a on it a better way to do that thing.
  * Do it right and leave a cool comment explaining what have you done, so I can figure that and research later :).
  
Thanks in advance :)
